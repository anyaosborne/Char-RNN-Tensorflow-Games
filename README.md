# Char-RNN-Tensorflow-Games

This is a slightly modified version of [*sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow*](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow) we used for a class project on Neural Net Methods to train the machine to generate Wikipedia-style descriptions of video games. This project represents the **Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN)** for character-level language models in Python using Tensorflow. The original inspiation comes from Andrej Karpathy's [*char-rnn*](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn). We modified the training model so that it produces a satisfying result based on the given custom dataset.

## Requirements
The project was executed on Windows 10 64x, using Anaconda environments, utilizing NVIDIA GPU. Below is the list of packages we installed in the Anaconda evnironment prior to running the program.
* **TensorFlow 1.15.0** (tensorflow-gpu==1.15) - We used the following installation guide - [Anaconda TensorFlow](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/tensorflow/?highlight=tensorflow). 
* Install **pip** - We used [pip 21.0.1](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pip)
* **Python 3+** - We used Python 3.7.9, but it can work with 2.7, 3.6, 3.5, and 3.4.
* Install **numpy** into your environment. The version we used is 1.20.0. Here is a guide on [Installing NUMPY](https://numpy.org/install/).
* Lastly, you will likely need to install **six 1.15.0**. [Six](https://pypi.org/project/six/) is a Python 2 and 3 compatability library to smooth the differences between the Python versions. 

## How to Execute The Code
1. To train, run [train.py](https://github.com/anyaosborne/Char-RNN-Tensorflow-Games/blob/main/train.py). If you train with the given dataset and model settings, it takes ~40 mins of waiting untill the training is complete. The command to run the training is `python train.py` (make sure the path in the evnironment is correct). To access all the parameters use `python train.py --help`.
2. In result of training, it will create new [logs](https://github.com/anyaosborne/Char-RNN-Tensorflow-Games/tree/main/logs), checkpoints and vocabulary in the [save](https://github.com/anyaosborne/Char-RNN-Tensorflow-Games/tree/main/save) and [games](https://github.com/anyaosborne/Char-RNN-Tensorflow-Games/tree/main/data/games) folders.
3. The sample output is generated from the saved checkpoints. To receive one, run `python sample.py`. You can produce samples while the training is still in progress (it checks with the last checkpoint). However, it works only in CPU or using another GPU. To force CPU mode, use `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""` and `unset CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` afterward
(resp. `set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""` and `set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=` on Windows). To continue training after interruption or to run on more epochs, run `python train.py --init_from=save`.

## About Dataset
You can use any plain text file as input. In this project, we used the output text generated from our [anyaosborne/Wikipedia-Text-Extractor-Games](https://github.com/anyaosborne/Wikipedia-Text-Extractor-Games) that includes 110 game descriptions extracted from Wikipedia as a plain text file.

## Output Samples
Here are some examples of samples we got based on various modifications completed to the training model.

#### Sample From the Inital Training
This one is based on full descriptions of 110 games:

#### Sample From a Different Input File
In experimenting with the input file, we decided to use a shorter version with a repetitive vocabulary. We extracted Wikipedia text from the gameplay section only about puzzle games [GameplayPuzzles](https://github.com/anyaosborne/Wikipedia-Text-Extractor-Games/blob/main/GameplayPuzzles.txt). Here is the sample we received.

##### 659/660 (epoch 109), train_loss = 2.161, time/batch = 0.084

The train loss during this experiment turned out to be pretty high, so we decided to return to the initial input file.

#### Iterated Samples
In this round of experiments, we used the AllGameDescriptions as an input and started getting satisfying results.

## Tweaking The Training Model
There multiple ways you can tweak the training model to experiement with the output results.

1. You can start with cleaning the input.txt to as much as possible (e.g. we removed unnessary symbols, line spaces, headings, etc.)
3. Use tensorboard to compare all of your runs visually to aid in experimenting (see more info below).
4. Tweak `--rnn_size`to somewhat from 128 if you have a lot of input data. We've got a large input file, so our `--rnn_size` was 400.
5. Tweak `--num_layers` from 2 to 3 but it is recommended no higher unless you have experience (e.g. we used 3 layers).
6. Tweak `--seq_length` up from 50 based on the length of a valid input string. In our input we used sentenced, so we set it up to 64 characters. For names, you can use <=12 characters. An lstm cell will "remember" for durations longer than this sequence, but the effect falls off for longer character distances.
7. Once you've done all that, you can add some dropout. Start with `--output_rate 0.8` and maybe end up with both `--input_rate 0.8` `--output_rate 0.5` only after exhausting all the above values.

## Tensorboard
To visualize training progress, model graphs, and internal state histograms:  fire up Tensorboard and point it at your `log_dir`.  E.g.:
```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir=./logs/
```
Then open a browser to [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) or the correct IP/Port specified.
